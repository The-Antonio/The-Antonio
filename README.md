- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing Android apps!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming in Kotlin...among other things.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me -- My email is AnthonyPoulos@protonmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think that Android is far better than iPhone. (I guess that the writing is on the wall with that one.)
